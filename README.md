Advanced Data Mining Methods in Computational Genomics.

In this work we analyse two datasets: a lymphoma dataset from Affymetrix gene expression microarrays and the TCGA Head and Neck Squamous Carcinoma (HNSC) dataset of RNA-seq expression profiles. In particular we want to perform exploratory data analysis and differential analysis using R and then building a classifier able to predict the class of a sample starting from the expression matrix.
